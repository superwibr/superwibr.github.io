    The Etigeox Research Foundation is the odd child of the Ministry of Progress. Taken over by lead researcher Henry Carthage, they regularly commit crimes against humanity in their quest for scientific advancement. Still de-jure owned by the government, they continue to do their job of researching the new technologies the various other ministries asked for.
