<h2>Cyty Farre</h2>
<p>
    The capital of the territories of Entry Farre, Cyty Farre was one of the fist settlements in the Lost World. Set atop its characteristic inverted marble pyramid, the cyty's name, and by extension Farre's name itself, came from engravings on the four central pillars around the ruined Upholder that now form the Pulling Plaza. It is stuck in a permanent blazing day from the so-called "holy light" which is in fact simply a dimensional rupture raining light onto the area. Shutters were placed around this light at a point in the past, before the first losses, but the engraving on the pillars dictate that this actually stopped the Upholder from working properly. 
    It is home to the new headquarters of the Entrylands Authority, a benevolant dictature that seizes any

<h2>Darke</h2>

<h2>The Flats</h2>

<h2>Destiny</h2>
<p>
    An opulent planet which was lost in its entirety when its star suddenly vanished. Being part of the same system as Polarius, the economy between the planets was never ruptured when they were both dunked into Darke's Ocean.
    It is very rare to see such a large thing get lost and end up in Farre, but it is thought most of the things in Farre were actually all lost at some point in the past.

<h2>Polarius</h2>
<p>
    A frozen planet exploited and mined by the inhabitants of Destiny. Very rich in heavy metals and a very tough variety of high-crystalline ice. Home to a few rich merchants residing in the NINE district
