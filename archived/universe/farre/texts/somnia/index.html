<h1>Somnia</h1>

<p>
    <em>
        A wailing strong enough to burst eardrums rang across the landscape, shaking trees and scaring creatures
        away.
        Up in the sky, a formation of flesh and bone, a monolith like a continent of porous blood-soaked sponge.
        It had awoken, slowly flapping immense paddle wings in a majestic intervention against nature.
        That beauty, with every sappy and bloody streak in the sky, was soon overshadowed by what it was leaving behind.
        They had eyes, they flew, moved like a dragon, a snake, perhaps a streaming and flailing strip,
        of tendons and of muscles.
        And the wail split into a million.
        They were hungry.

    The setting for Somnia is the inaccessible desert beneath the Eternal Sky in Farre.
    The loop of falling in the Eternal Sky was put in by the Architects to prevent what was down there from escaping, and vice-versa.
    Some may be unlucky enough to end up in Somnia when they die, but they would never know, since passage back to Farre is impossible.
    This barren and twisted land is the byproduct of the Architect's experimentation, and all their failed or rejected creations were thrown down here.
    For some reason, the Architects never removed Somnia as a valid destination for new people, so a small civilization akin to the late days of the american Great Race West has sprouted over the years.
    This is where we are.
