<h1>The Place Called Cyty Farre (introduction)</h1>
<p>
    From wherever you may be,
    From whichever universe you were plucked,
    Where you end up, you will see,
    Is this small island tightly tucked
    In a sky of sea,
    The place called Cyty Farre.
    
    The ancient grounds of marble,
    With them still their pasty white sheen,
    With new buildings swelling over the ruins,
    Their jagged spikes unseen.
    On the tin rooftops the eternal sunlight gleams.
    
    Atop this inverted spike,
    Flat and battered with burning light,
    The citizens run from space to space,
    Cyty Farre, they call this place.
</p>
<p>
    Off the edge and into sky,
    Dense coulds fill the way
    With misty darkness here to stay
    In the Eternal Sky, to live, we try.
    
    There's a door in the mist.
    A lone door, which like on sea lists.
    “The Flats”, we call where it leads
    And on light and knowledge it feeds.
    
    East of Farre there lies a wall.
    Near it, time seems to stall.
    The eerie dark surface seems infinite,
    And for all we know, it indeed has no limit.
    
    “What if darkness was a place?”
    You answer when you are face to face
    With a cicular depression of liquid night
    Within the wall that rests no sight.
    
    Within the realm of Darke,
    some people stay.
    They speak their tongue with click and bark,
    They do not see, nor night nor day.

<h3>self-analysis</h3>

        What
            This poem is about a world I created and which might see the day as a book (Allabaster Crowe's Field Guide to
            Farre). In it we explore the places we can go to directly from Cyty Farre, the capital of Entry Farre and the
            place where all people lost arrive.
            The first three verses are about the Cyty itself, of which the inhabitants of the world know little about,
            except that it is old and that the ground cannot be broken.
            The fourth is about the Eternal Sky, the immense void underneath the floating island of Cyty Farre. It is
            unknown if it ends.
            The fifth is about the portal door in the mist before the Sky. It leads to a boxed in land where people go to
            learn or teach, and which the only source of energy is solar power.
            The last three describe The Wall, of which the dimensions are unknown, and the realm of Darke (which is commonly
            referred to as The Shadows by outsiders). It is made of physical darkness and gets colder the further from the
            wall you go, inwards. Sound is deeply dampened by the liquid dark that fills the air so sharp noises compose the
            language of the citizens.
            The whole of the poem is meant to get more and more unfamiliar, beginning with the unsettling caused by the
            break in rhyme in the second verse, attempting to make the reader double take the way they are interpreting the
            poem, and concludes at the end with the sudden halt of the last verse, representing the silence of Darke to an
            untrained ear.
            The narrator is external, but ambiguous. Canonically, it is told by a Darke engineer whose only cares are
            objective truths, and uncertainty unsettles. Allabaster Crowe places an embellished version at the beginning of
            his encyclopedia, the Field Guide to Farre, to be studied by students newly arrived in the realm.

    <li>How
        As I've said in the end of #1, I used the assumption that the reader is expecting rhymes &amp; is expecting some
        form of morale or conclusion to mildly unsettle as they read.
        The more relatively normal parts of the poem I purposefully break rhythm of to make the reader question what
        hidden meaning lies under when there is none, and I let them end off in a momentum of simple rhymes so they run
        off and feel the emptiness and silence of the ghost 9th verse (dots as tongue clicks and commas as sharp shouts,
        left to be interpreted by the reader.)
        Otherwise, I purposefully kept the poem “dry” in terms of poetic tools, so it may feel like it was translated
        from clicks and chirps, of which the English language cannot capture the intricate essence developed over
        thousands of years of existance with only damp noise, smell and touch to guide.</li>
