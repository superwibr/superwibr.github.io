<h1>Entry #1: The Aloft Gorge</h1>
<p>
    We had found it two years prior.
    The Aloft was much more grand than what we had seen in the illustrations;
    It breathed with an unnerving hum, slumbering in the comfortable heat of the brimstone caves. Its pulse permeated the air with a changing stillness, as if the heart of that creature removed sound instead of making it. We dared to walk upon it, and we walked for half a day before we reached its first articulation. The Aloft was immense, unknowable, and horribly glorious. According to the bestiary, it once had reaved the land with its tyrannical hunger, releasing drones from its hive.
    The Hungers.
    The grand winged thing was some form of both queen and hive's home, hosting all of its gorey court on tendonny tendrils and in its oversized pores. Some of the Hungers had eyes, and they visibly jerked when we approached them, so we quickly ran away.
    Oh boy, if we knew what would befall us then...

    He was running as if his life depended on it, and from his expression we could tell it -- and ours -- may very truly have been in the balance.
    "The Aloft... It's... Moving.... Out, Awake...", he spurted, out of breath.
    Just days before, we had gone back to the caves and Jamie had a bad cold, had sneezed on its back.
    It had twitched as we left, as if it was coughing.
    That's when it got sick, and moved out for sustenance.

    A wailing strong enough to burst eardrums rang across the landscape, shaking trees and scaring creatures away.
    Up in the sky, a formation of flesh and bone, a monolith like a continent of porous blood-soaked sponge.
    It had awoken, slowly flapping immense paddle wings in a majestic intervention against nature.
    That beauty, with every sappy and bloody streak in the sky, was soon overshadowed by what it was leaving behind.
    They had eyes, they flew, moved like a dragon, a snake, perhaps a streaming and flailing strip,
    of tendons and of muscles.
    And the wail split into a million.
    They were hungry.
