<h1>Entry #3: The Cursed Boy</h1>
<p>
    Hundreds of miles travelled in less than a few weeks. Each day, we are a new village. Our migration westwards is making us leave behind yhr ravaged lands that we once called home. Each morning, the sticky ropes catch up to us. Each night, someone gives in to sleep, passing from the arms of Morpheus to those of Thanatos before they can realize it. The Hungers can smell the sweet sap of their delicious dreams and inch in over the darkest hours to help themselves to a free feast. Sometimes, the sreams of the Aloft still reach us, those distorted screeches like an old echo bottled up awaken insanity in some, and fear in all. It was the eclipse's dark morning that we entered the forest, a crescent of red sun in the sky taunting us with the same hue that poisonned our days. The Hungers were slown by the new terrain; perhaps we would have peace. Even so, strange  creatures also resided in the groves, such as mantises as big as a child or standing skeletons of wood held up by a moving mass of greenery.
    Some of us became blood-sick, their lungs gummed with the mist of coagulated blood that wouldn't leave the air. Those same people seemed to feel the Hunger's arrival before the Warning resounded, becoming our ephemeral sentinels in the few days before the illness caused them to expire.
    The evening of the new moon, we found a boy laying unconscious on the last shred of paved road reddened by the red biomass of tendons. His skin was seared in places by the mark of a feeding hunger's tendrils, yet he still breathed. We freed him of the hemoglobin glue and carried him in a makeshift stretcher from an undeployed tent.
    He awakened at midnight, and the guard woke up a few experts, doctors and, others. He had no memory, but blankly stared at us with an uncomfortable look with his haemorated eyes. His pupil was shattered, too perfectly to be simply a wound, in the shape of a four-pointed red star.

    At this pace, all semblance of what was once going to be an encyclopedia for the new age of the tyrannical reign of that bloodstain in the sky has evaporated. I had tried to make it more descriptive than narrative, but without much ability to write from a non-participant point of view, this has now become more of a log of our progress through the new landscape and bloodied air, and so be it.
    I do not expect the journal itself to last much longer.

    These weeks have been grey and sullen, the rain beating down the bloody fog from the air.
