**INFO ABOUT SCENEXE SCRIPTS**

Most are defunct. Pretty obvious. Some have been deleted, just look through the commit history before this file to find them.
Some are working, and are mildly to greatly useful.

fovmod.js :: still works to alter the FOV using the scrollwheel. This is not really cheating as you can't see what's outside of your actual FOV but since the FOV area us a square you can see parts that would fall ofscreen.

scenenavlib.js :: medium sized lib to make a scenexe client navigate, pathfind, etc. (requires hidsim.js)

packetdebug.js :: allows for debugging scenexe packets and infering the xurrent xor key (requires hidsim.js)

tikups_exe.user.js :: fully fledged scenexe.io multitab client with pathing and fuckery
