<h1>Entry #2: The Hungers</h1>
<p>
    The Hungers are the members of the Aloft's hive. On the day it rose, the Hungers descended onto the lands by means of the tendril ropes that streamed from the underside of the Gorge's wings. They spread like a fungal stain, a disease, anywhere the Aloft slowly drifted over. 
    The second night was the worst. 
    That was the night we realised sleeping was no longer an option.
    The whole town was overwhelmed, and anyone who was soundly sleeping woke up in screams and terrified sweats as they noticed their houses were permeated with stringy flesh, with eyes blooming on their walls and Hungers looming over their beds.
    The fact that they awoke halted the Hungers, and they stayed static whenever they were in someone's line of sight.
    The townsfolk unanimously decided to pack a caravan and try to migrate away from the Aloft's corrupted path, and to create a quarter-day clock so there would always be someone awake and alert.
    The other towns didn't have our luck. As we left, we passed by Eamestowm. The whole village was strapped with red, held tight with bound muscle fibres and a network of arteries. The mayor was standing at the end of the main road, facing us. We could see other folk's silhouettes through the bloody, misty fog. But the mayor was showing us what would have happened if we hadn't been such light sleepers: 
    It was as though all the epiderma had been skinned away, and the nerves and blood vessels had overgrown like hair, or vines. What was slowly sulking around was only a shadow of what the person had been, their guts and mind consumed and repurposed elsewhere, their lungs forcing out the same low hum and wail as the Aloft, in perfect synchronicity with the rest of what were our neighbours, our friends. Family. Those remnants were named Sulks by us, and that horrible and unnerving idling groan the Warning. 
    Our caravan moved on as the Sulks followed us with their eyes.
    The eyes of the Hunger.
