<h1>Chapter 5: A Meeting</h1>
<p>
    That person was looking at him, he knew it. From the beginning, one of the humanoids had taken great interest in documenting their surroundings and what the small travelling town encountered, which included him. He wasn’t sure what to call this person. Was it a boy or a girl, or something else? Perhaps it wasn’t even a human, but a clever masquerade. He couldn’t really tell, since it looked traumatized like the rest of everyone there. “Why would that even matter?”, he thought to himself. After all, he had more pressing things to think of, such as the fact that he had impulsively adopted a monster, with the squelching and clicking approval of the hive. He couldn’t comprehend that raw and primal language per se, but he could grasp at its edges and barely understand it. He could talk to the things, that he now knew. He also knew he desperately needed some ointment for the itchy strikes that had resurfaced across his body. Everyone was still fearful towards the Hungers, and justifiably so. After all, their gory queen had reaved their home, scarring it with death and leaving the lands themselves to be withered and consumed. Even he was quite afraid, despite knowing they would leave him alone. They were still abominable creatures.
    The person had sat down before him as he had been thinking. He hadn’t moved from that bench, he realized, since the little orb he’d now named Jeremy had woken him. At first he tried to slam it into the ground, but the quiet pleas of the thing as it bounced away had a weird feeling to him, as if he was intuitively understanding some forgotten mother tongue. Since then he’d just sat on the carved log with the ball in his hands.

    And now that human was sat on the other side of the campfire’s ashes, staring at him.
    He interrupted them right before they were about to speak.
    “Who you are.” It was more a statement to be confirmed than a question, and the timing of it had them visibly startled.
    “My name is, well, Nameless. You can call me Nelle or Nellie, though.”
    He looked up from his hand, his shattered red irises occluded through the ends of his hair.
    “What you are.” That second unfulfilled statement seemed to have more weight than the first. This whole conversation felt unreal to the both of them. The shock still enduring from their spontaneous exile, all they had lost, and the people they had left behind had plunged them into a state of distanced thought, where internal conflict prevailed over socialisation. On the other hand, the cursed boy had no memory of anything prior to his awakening on the hot pavement, and had been observed by all, before being held up like a prophet simply because he kept what amounted to really angry meatballs at bay.

    The conversation ended much more fruitfully than it has started. His stalker was indeed a human — he still didn’t know why he felt distanced from other humanoids — and had a great interest in the stories of the beasts, of which the Aloft Gorge was the first and of the most ancient. His ability to communicate with its hive in some way was of great interest to the young scholar, and she wanted to study them and help the boy learn how to better use these abilities. Many questions were passed back and forth between them: Would he be able to create and summon the tendrils? Could he eat dreams, or perhaps reverse the Sulking? All questions left open distracted them from their person and more towards their theorizing, and in that impersonal train of thought bounced between them lasted well into the evening, as the camp was set up in a new location. A thin bond was beginning to form between them, and it was a welcome amicability in these dark days.
