<h1>Entry #4: Hope</h1>
<p>
    We soon realized the boy was like our blood-sick; he could feel the Aloft's hive, but he didn't perish from corrupted lungs like our poor friends. He wasn't very talkative and avoided eye contact, which was understandable given the traumatic situation we'd found him in, but our mayor took great interest in him, for he could be our permanent sentry, and we wouldn't have to let another life be snuffed by the bloody froth that permeated the air. Another very intriguing property of this quiet boy would be revealed on the first night he was with us, at our camp at the edge of a clearing…

    It was the dead of night when we heard the shrieks, and then the sobs. The Hungers and their filin tracks led up to our camp in a near perfect circle, amassing at the edges yet not entering the eerie ring. On a normal night, if we could even call the beginning of the Aloft's tyranny normal now, we would be woken up by a dying sentry whose scabbed lungs were nearly popped, and we would move as the balls of the dream-sucking abominations stood still at the notice of our waking.
    This night however, the crying young man still sitting around the campfire kept them at bay. While his star-pupil eyes had cleared up over the day, they were now once more filled with the red of his veins, leaking myoglobin as his chest shook in shallow gasps. In the last embers of the fire and the thin moon rays through the dark leaves, it could be seen that the burns on his arms were reddened once more.
    It was then that the winds shifted and we saw the clearing clearly.
    People lurched backwards and craned their necks, afraid yet morbidly curious, as humans are.
    The ground was striated with thinly reaching tendrils of ligament and artery, stretching from the clearing to a small red ball he had in his hands.
    A minuscule hunger, with a skin not sliced or inflated with blood. A tiny little thing that lightly touched his fingers with wires of nerve that anchored into the burns- no, the still-fresh scars of his horrible transformation.
    We hadn't found him, on that road, having by some blessing escaped becoming a Sulk.
    We had witnessed the curse of his survival.

    It was an uneasy calm, seeing the hungers simply go about their commutes while ignoring us, that was sure. Most of what was left of town — about 27 people or so — had been heavily dissociated since the awakening of the Gorge, but now no physical effort could keep their minds away from the new reality: the random teenager we'd picked up off the searing hot road was now presenting a ray of hope. When he had stopped sobbing in pain from the resurgence of his peculiar condition, he had quietly pronounced a few words: “I hear them, they hear me. I will sing for them.”

    He hummed a tune whose lyrics must be long forgotten to the creature cupped in his palms, and the ring of Hungers eased and quieted. Their twisted mouthes shut. Their glaring eyes eased. We'd all looked at each other as this miracle was enacted: Hungers finally satiated. It seems they would eat any dream, waking or sleeping, past or future, in mind or word or song alike. The boy named the little ball Jeremy. It was almost cute, with two similarly sized eyes and a thin mouth, almost forming a face that could be attributed to a regular living thing. Its dry skin was taught and tinted slightly yellow-ish, and it stretched out thin nerve instead of thick ropes of blood. 
    The other Hungers, now at ease with our presence, simply travelled around the area, doing whatever they did during the day, which seemed to consist of splitting up to hunt birds and squirrels for their physical sustenance and sharing these resources via improvised veins to the others that found suitable places to rest. Even the beasts of nightmares still needed to simply live, it seems.
    This didn't, however, detract from our fear. The party of us humanoids would steer clear of the Hungers, for we knew the only thing preventing them from seeing us as a free feast was the boy's knowledge of soft songs and aged lullabies. 
    The boy, the cursed boy, him, the young man…
    Who was he? What was his name? How did he get here, and did he remember anything? Would he know where we should go?
    It is decided, I must set aside my narration. My pages are running out, my ink running dry, and my photographing device is out of film. He might not be in the mood to talk, but I'm sure his recent success loosened him up. Perhaps we could befriend each other, once the nightmares cease to congest our waking slumber…
